# E.BTC Miner for Pulsechain

## What is E.BTC?

- EVMBitcoinToken is a meme coin on Pulsechain with a 21M supply.
- Initial mints (first 210,000 transactions) produced 50 eBTC rewards with a maximum of 25 transactions per wallet. 
- Every 210,000 transactions, the mint reward decreases by half.

## E.BTC Miner - Features

- Automatically and seamlessly generates new wallets for each mining session, thereby circumventing the limitation of 25 transactions per wallet.
- Dynamic Adjustment to Gas Prices (mints at user-specified gas limits)
- Mint E.BTC tokens based on predefined conditions (defined PLS balance or defined number of transactions)
- Transfer mined E.BTC tokens and leftover PLS back to the main wallet.
- Detailed logging of mining activities and transactions on screen
- Automatically records every EIP-55 compliant address and its corresponding private key generated by the software in the EvmBitcoinToken.log file, which is useful for diagnostic purposes.


##  E.BTC Miner - TODO

We're reaching out to the developer community to contribute to the ongoing development and enhancement of E.BTC Miner, to help us with the following proposed updates, among others that you may identify as beneficial:

- Implement an auto-recovery feature that enables the program to automatically retrieve the last address from the EvmBitcoinToken.log and gracefully resume operations following a crash. This will help in maintaining the continuity of the mining process without manual intervention, thus saving time and reducing potential errors.
- Automatically re-submit the transaction, if the program gets stuck on 'Transaction not yet confirmed, waiting...' 
- Introduce a feature for the manual input of the 'Seeding' wallet's public address and private key at runtime. This update will provide users with a secure method to input sensitive information without hard-coding it into the script. By prompting users for their credentials at startup, we enhance the security of the wallet and adhere to best practices for sensitive data management.
- Turn this code into a browser-based solution.

Your contributions will not only improve the E.BTC Miner but also ensure a safer and more efficient experience for all users.
**Warning:** If you want to participate in development, always make sure that your private key is not exposed in your pull requests and commits.

## Requirements and Installation

Install Dependencies:
- Ensure Python 3.9 is installed on your system
- Go into the project directory where the requirements.txt file is located.
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required Python libraries.

The program was tested to work using these versions:
- `Python` (3.9)
- `web3` (6.2.0)
- `requests` (2.28.2)


## Configuration

Before running the miner, configure the following settings in the `E.BTC-Miner.py` script:

- `main_wallet_address`: Your main Pulsechain wallet address.
- `main_wallet_address_private_key`: Private key for the above wallet 
- Gas-related settings such as `only_claim_if_gas_is_below` to specify the maximum gas price (in Gwei) you're willing to pay for transactions.
- `max_Spend_PLS`: The maximum amount of PLS you want to spend on mining.
- `max_total_transactions`: The maximum number of transactions before the program stops.
- `cooling_period_between_new_wallets`: Time in seconds to wait before creating a new wallet for mining.

**Warning:** Be cautious with your private key and never share it with others.


## Usage

To start the mining process, execute the script from the command line:

```bash
python E.BTC-Miner.py
```

The script will automatically handle the mining process based on the configured parameters, including wallet creation, token minting, and funds transfer.

## Troubleshooting

In case the program halts unexpectedly and cannot resume on its own, locate the EvmBitcoinToken.log that is automatically created every time the program runs and contains every EIP-55-compliant address created by the program along with its private key. 

Retrieve the most recent private key (the last one from the bottom) in the log and import it into your preferred wallet, such as Metamask or Rabby.

This will enable you to manually transfer any E.BTC or PLS balances back to your primary 'Seeding' wallet.
